                            admit it.Oh well, we’ve all at some point had a really
                            good teacher and we knew before exams that we were not
                            getting any assistance. We also knew it was not from a
                            place of wickedness but from a place of confidence
                            that the teacher has done all that was needed and
                            taught us well enough to trust in our ability to take
                            the exams without cheating, or fear of failure.

                            go through tests? What do distress, challenges, and
                            tribulation do for our journey and worse off, why does
                            our teacher seem to be silent through it? Sometimes it
                            takes us unawares, like a “tear a piece of paper and
                            write your name” kind of flash test on a Monday
                            morning.

                            level, we’ve got to show that we’ve understood all the
                            current level has taught us, as the knowledge gained
                            is not for the school or the teacher, but for our own
                            good. For if we graduate from a class without gaining
                            the prerequisite knowledge, we are bound to struggle

                            just for the love of God, cannot understand what’s
                            going on. In situations like this, there’s a high
                            probability that you missed class on the first day the
                            elementary was taught, or you were present but did not
                            understand it at all, and except by divine
                            intervention or through revision, you’re most likely
                            to hate that topic for the rest of your life and
